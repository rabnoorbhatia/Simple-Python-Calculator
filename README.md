# Simple Python Calculator

This is a simple calculator written in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program continues running until the user chooses to exit.

## Features

- Add two numbers  
- Subtract one number from another  
- Multiply two values  
- Divide one number by another (with built-in protection against division by zero)  
- Repeats calculations as long as the user wants

## How It Works

1. The user selects an operation from the menu.
2. The program asks for two numeric inputs.
3. It runs the selected math operation and displays the result.
4. The user can choose to perform another calculation or exit.

## Usage

Run the program using:

```
python calculator.py
```

When prompted, enter:

- `1` for addition  
- `2` for subtraction  
- `3` for multiplication  
- `4` for division  

Then enter two numbers when requested.

## Example Interaction

```
Select operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide

Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 1
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 6
Result: 11
Do another calculation? (yes/no): no
```

## Purpose

This project is ideal for beginners learning:

- Python functions  
- User input handling  
- Basic control structures such as loops and conditionals

Feel free to modify and extend the calculator with additional mathematical operations or a graphical interface.
